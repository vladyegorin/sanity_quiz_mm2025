# Sanity Quiz - A Psychological Horror Quiz  

## About the Project  
Sanity quiz is an interactive quiz app designed to slowly break the player's sense of reality. The questions start off normal, but as the user progresses, the answers become increasingly bizarre, the UI distorts, and the panic level rises. The quiz features dynamic UI effects, a panic button that reacts to user choices, and psychological horror elements to create an unsettling experience.  

## Technologies Used  
- Kotlin – The app is built using Kotlin for Android development.  
- Glide ([bumptech/glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)) – Used for efficient image loading and handling dynamic UI effects.  

## Developers  
This project was created by:  
- Vladimir Yegorin  
- Dyk Kyong Do  

## Features  
- Panic System: A dynamic panic meter that increases based on the user’s choices.  
- UI Distortions: As the quiz progresses, text glitches, colors change, and answers swap unexpectedly.  
- Forced Interactions: Some questions manipulate the user's input, making them feel out of control.  
- Psychological Horror Elements: Whispering sounds, fake memory manipulation, and eerie messages enhance the fear factor.
